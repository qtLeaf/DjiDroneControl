# DjiDroneControl
A project based on DJI Mobile SDK V5 Sample
 for automated control and telemetry logging of DJI drones.
The goal is to experiment with autonomous flight logic and real-time data recording.

- Current State

 the project is able to save telemetry logs of core drone information, including:
 
  Attitude (roll, pitch, yaw)
  
  GPS coordinates (latitude, longitude, altitude)
  
  IMU data (accelerometer and gyroscope bias, temperature)
  
  Battery level
 
 Logs are automatically generated when the drone is connected and stored in the app’s local directory for later analysis.
